print(f"""Hello my fellow {pluralnoun1}, it's me, George Washington, the first {occupation} 
I am writing from (the) {place1},where I have been living for the past {number} years. I am concerned 
by the {adjective1} state of affairs in America these days. It seems your politicians are more concerned with 
{ing_verb1} one another than with listening to the {pluralnoun2} of the people. When declared our independance from
(the) {place2},  we set forth on a/an {adjective2} path guided by the everyday {pluralnoun3}. If we're going 
to keep {ing_verb2}, then we're going to have to learn how to respect all {pluralnoun4}. Don't get me wrong; we had {adjecive3} problems 
in my day, too. Benjamin Franklin once called me a/an {noun1} and kicked me in the {bodypart1}. But at 
the end of the day, we were able to {verb1} in harmony. Let us find that spirit once again, or
else I'm taking my {bodypart2} off the quarter""")
